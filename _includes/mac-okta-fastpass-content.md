Let's set up __Okta Fastpass__. 

Okta FastPass provides a quick, easy and secure way to sign in and helps protect you from phishing.

Before setting up Okta Verify, ensure that Bluetooth is enabled on your mobile device. Use your control center or mobile Settings to toggle Bluetooth on.

__NOTE__: Biometrics (Touch ID) are preferred when using Okta FastPass. If you do not enable/use biometrics on your Block-issued device you will be prompted for another factor (password) when using Okta FastPass.

{% include figure url="/assets/images/enable-touch-id.png" image_path="/assets/images/enable-touch-id.png" %}

If you opted-in for Touch ID, you will see the above screen. If you skipped Touch ID, please move to the next step:

Click [Enable Touch ID](){: .btn .btn--inverse .btn--small}.

If prompted, authenticate using Touch ID.

Success! 🎉 You're all setup with Okta Fastpass!
