Now click [Sign in with Slack](){: .btn .btn--inverse .btn--small} and a Chrome window will open up.

Click __Try entering a workspace URL__ at the bottom of the window.

Where it says “your-workspace” in the url, type in “square” and Continue.

Next, click Sign in with Block SSO. This should open an Okta window where you can authenticate.

Next you will be asked which Workspace to join out of __Block__, __Square__, __Cash App__, __TIDAL__, or __TBD__. Choose the one that best fits your role; you can join any of the other Workspaces later.

Click [Launch in Slack](){: .btn .btn--inverse .btn--small} for the Workspace of your choice.

Click [Open Slack](){: .btn .btn--inverse .btn--small} when Chrome asks to __Open Slack?__

__NOTE:__ If Slack doesn't open in the app the first time, simply click sign in again within the App and try a second time.
