## 🎉 Congratulations
Welcome to Block! Let's get you set up so you can get to work right away. First, some ground rules:

* On Day 1, instructions will be sent to your personal email to set your initial password to your corporate login early in the morning.
* You will not be able to begin this process until you have recieved this email.
* You can optionally join IT Office Hours to get technical support from a member of our IT Team if you run into any questions. The Google Meet link for this onboarding session will be provided to you via onboarding communications.

## 📱 Before you start!
Before starting you will need to set your initial Block password. You will also want to download the ![Okta Verify](/assets/images/duo-icon.png) __Okta Verify__ app from your phone's App Store. We will use this app for our 2-Factor Authentication.
Once this is installed, go ahead and __open it__.
