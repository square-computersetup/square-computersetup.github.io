Now that we have your Okta set up and your password reset, we are going to setup Google Chrome on your computer.


We need to create a new profile within Chrome that is signed into your Block account.

Open Chrome and click on the __profile__ icon in the top right.

Select __+ Add__ on the little window that comes up

{% include figure url="/assets/images/alt-chrome-02.png" image_path="/assets/images/alt-chrome-02.png" %}

On the nex screen select __Sign in__

{% include figure url="/assets/images/alt-chrome-03.png" image_path="/assets/images/alt-chrome-03.png" %}

Enter your __Okta__ login information

Select an __Authentication Method__

You __may__ see the next window, if you do select __Continue__

{% include figure url="/assets/images/alt-chrome-06.png" image_path="/assets/images/alt-chrome-06.png" %}

On the next screen select __Create__

{% include figure url="/assets/images/alt-chrome-07.png" image_path="/assets/images/alt-chrome-07.png" %}

Then choose __Yes, Iâ€™m in__

{% include figure url="/assets/images/alt-chrome-08.png" image_path="/assets/images/alt-chrome-08.png" %}

Once you have done that it will open a new Chrome window. If you click on the profile icon again you will see the new profile added.
