# Macbook Setup

Let's get your MacBook set up!

Press the __power__ button located at the top-right corner of the keyboard:

Shortly after boot-up, you will be asked to select your Country or Region, any accessibility options you may require, and preferred language:

Please select “Set up as new” and click __Continue__

**IMPORTANT**
Connect your device to a wired or wireless network, as an internet connection is required for setup.
* In the office? Connect to __Block-Guest__. You can get the password from the local IT team or a colleague with access to go/wifi.
