# Macbook Setup

Let's get your MacBook set up!

Press the __power__ button located at the top-right corner of the keyboard:

{% include figure url="/assets/images/mac-01-power.jpg" image_path="/assets/images/mac-01-power.jpg" caption="(if you have a Mac Mini, the power button is in the rear)" %}

Shortly after boot-up, you will be asked to select your Country or Region, any accessibility options you may require, and preferred language:

{% include figure url="/assets/images/mac-02-locale-BigSur.jpg" image_path="/assets/images/mac-02-locale-BigSur.jpg"  %}

**IMPORTANT**
Connect your device to a wired or wireless network, as an internet connection is required for setup.
* In the office? Connect to __Block-Guest__. You can get the password from the local IT team or a colleague with access to go/wifi.
