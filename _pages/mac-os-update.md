# Apple's MacOS Update

Let's make sure your Mac Operating System (OS) is up-to-date.

From the Apple menu  in the corner of your screen, choose __System Settings__.

Next, click __General__ on the left side of the window. Then click __Software Update__ on the right.

{% include figure url="/assets/images/macos-update-02.png" image_path="/assets/images/macos-update-02.png" %}

Software Update will then check for new available software.

If Software Update finds new software, click the button to install it. The button might be named Update Now, Upgrade Now, Install Now, or Restart Now. You will then be asked to enter your laptop password.

If you have issues updating your Mac to the current version, please email mission-control@squareup.com
