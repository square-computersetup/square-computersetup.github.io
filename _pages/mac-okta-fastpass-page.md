Let's set up __Okta Fastpass__. 

Okta FastPass provides a quick, easy and secure way to sign in and helps protect you from phishing.

Before setting up Okta Verify, ensure that Bluetooth is enabled on both your MacBook and on your mobile device. 

To confirm this on your MacBook, click on the Control Center icon in the top right corner.

Now make sure Bluetooth is turned __on__ on your mobile device. Use your control center or mobile Settings to toggle Bluetooth on.
