# Managed Software Center Update

The Managed Software Center will open as soon as possible after you have signed into your account and completed the previous steps. 

{% include figure url="/assets/images/msc.png" image_path="assets/images/msc.png" %}

__Note:__ If the Managed Software Center doesn't open up, please open Launchpad, scroll to the next page, and click on the Managed Software Center to manually open it up.

{% include figure url="/assets/images/mac-launchpad-02.png" image_path="assets/images/mac-launchpad-02.png" %}
{% include figure url="/assets/images/mac-launchpad-03.png" image_path="assets/images/mac-launchpad-03.png" %}

Once Managed Software Updates have completed, it will prompt you about a __Forced logout for mandatory install__. 
Click [Log out and Update Now](){: .btn .btn--inverse .btn--small} to exit the installer and restart your laptop.

{% include figure url="/assets/images/mac-installs-logout.png" image_path="/assets/images/mac-installs-logout.png" width=54
    height=auto %}

You may see some updates happening after you logout. After you no longer see any visual indication that an update is happening, __Login__ again using your __Laptop Password__ (which may be different than your Okta password).

Once you're logged in, open the Managed Software Center, and click on __Updates__ to ensure all updates are completed. 

# Apple's MacOS Update
Equally important to the Managed Software Center updates, __it is critical to run's Apple Software Update__ as well. If your computer is out of date, you will not be able to reach any Block internal tools.

Please follow our guide: [update your Mac OS](/mac-os-update).
