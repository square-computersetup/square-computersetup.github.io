You may see some updates happening after you log out. After you no longer see any visual indication that an update is happening, __Log in__ again using your __Laptop Password__ (which may be different than your Okta password).

Once you're logged in, open the Managed Software Center, and click on __Check again__ to ensure all updates are completed. 

# Apple's MacOS Update
